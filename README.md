# StaffTrainer
A simple game to help with learning the note positions on a bass and treble clef.
## To play
Either clone the repo and open index.html in a browser of your choice or head to the
[github page](https://skrywerbeer.github.io/StaffTrainer/).
Tap the button with the same letter as the next note on the staff, if they match the
marker will disappear from the staff. After clearing all four markers, a new set will
automatically be generated.
